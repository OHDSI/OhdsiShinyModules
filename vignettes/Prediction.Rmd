# Introduction

Patient-level prediction lets users answer the question, who is at risk or an outcome during some time period within a target population.  For example, you can answer: who is at risk of developing angioedema within a year of starting lisinopril, in new users or lisinopril?


# Features and Functionalities

We define a **target cohort** as a set of patients with an exposure or interest and/or with evidence of having an indication of interest, an **outcome cohort** as a set of patients with evidence of the outcome of interest, and a **time-at-risk** as a period of time to where the patient is at risk of developing the outcome. The package shows performance of models developed to predict the outcome during the time-at-risk relative to the target cohort index for patients in the target cohort.

The first page lets you pick one or more target cohorts and outcome cohorts to restrict to.  Then a model design summary table is displayed restricted to the selected target and outcome cohorts. The model design summary aggregates the performances of models developed across different databases for the same model design (target cohort, outcome, time-at-risk, population inclusion criteria, model and data preprocessing).  The summary table includes the model design id, target cohort name, outcome cohort name, time-at-risk, the min/mean/max AUROC for models developed using the model design across databases as well as the number of databases included in diagostics, model development and model validation.

The first column of the summary table is a button that enables users to dive deeper into the results.  Users can select from:

- view models (this lets users see the performance of all models developed using the model design)
- view diagnostic (this lets users see the diagnostic results showing the suitability of the database for the model design)
- view report (this lets users view a html summary report of all the models developed using the model design)

## View models
The view models view shows all the model development/validation results for the selected model design.  The table shows the development database, validation data, target name, outcome name, time-at-risk (TAR), the AUROC, AUPRC, number of people in the target cohort, number of target cohort with the outcome during TAR, the percentage of the target population used for model validation (this is 100% when displaying external validation) and percentage of target population with the outcome during TAR.

Users can select a result view to explore the model more:

- View results (this lets users view the model, calibration/discrimination plots and net benefit plots).
- View attrition (this lets users see where patients were lost between paients in the database and the final target population).

## View diagnostic
The view diagnostic view shows diagnostics based on PROBAST, that aims to see the risk of bias in a model design when applied to a specific database.  Click [here](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30596875/) to read more about PROBAST.

## View report
The view report view displays a summary report of the results for the selected model design.  This requires additional R package dependencies that must be installed.  If the dependencies are not installed, a warning will display telling the user what package is missing.

# Utility and Application

Patient-level prediction enables users to identify who is at risk of developing some future outcome.  This can be used to guide clinical interventions or risk mitigation or early detection.
