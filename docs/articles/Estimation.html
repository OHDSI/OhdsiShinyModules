</h3>
<p>Observational healthcare data, comprising administrative claims and
electronic health records, present a rich source for generating
real-world evidence pertinent to treatment effects that directly impact
patient well-being. Within this realm, population-level effect
estimation assumes a pivotal role, focusing on elucidating the average
causal effects of exposures—such as medical interventions like drug
exposures or procedures—on specific health outcomes of interest.
Population-level effect estimation delves into two primary realms:
direct effect estimation and comparative effect estimation. In direct
effect estimation, the focus lies on discerning the effect of an
exposure on the risk of an outcome compared to no exposure, while
comparative effect estimation aims to delineate the effect of a target
exposure against a comparator exposure. By contrasting factual outcomes
with counterfactual scenarios—what happened versus what would have
occurred under different circumstances—these estimation tasks offer
critical insights into treatment selection, safety surveillance, and
comparative effectiveness. Whether probing individual hypotheses or
exploring multiple hypotheses concurrently, the overarching goal remains
consistent: to derive high-quality estimates of causal effects from the
intricate fabric of observational healthcare data.</p>

</h3>
<p>The Self-Controlled Case Series (SCCS) method offers a nuanced
approach to investigating the relationship between exposures and
outcomes within individual patients over time. SCCS designs are
particularly adept at comparing the rate of outcomes during times of
exposure to rates during periods of non-exposure, including before,
between, and after exposure episodes. By leveraging a Poisson regression
that is conditioned on the individual, the SCCS design inherently
addresses the question: “Given that a patient has the outcome, is the
outcome more likely to occur during exposed time compared to non-exposed
time?” The design choices outlined in the method are pivotal for
defining an SCCS question, with each choice playing a critical role in
the study’s design and outcomes:</p>
<p><strong>Target Cohort</strong>: This represents the treatment under
investigation. <strong>Outcome Cohort</strong>: This cohort signifies
the outcome of interest. <strong>Time-at-Risk</strong>: Identifies the
specific times when the risk of the outcome is considered, often
relative to the start and end dates of the target cohort.
<strong>Model</strong>: Defines the statistical model used to estimate
the effect, including adjustments for time-varying confounders if
necessary.</p>
<p>One of the SCCS design’s strengths is its robustness to confounding
by factors that differ between individuals, as each participant serves
as their own control. However, it remains sensitive to time-varying
confounding factors. To mitigate this, adjustments can be made for
factors such as age, seasonality, and calendar time, enhancing the
model’s accuracy.</p>
<p>An advanced variant of the SCCS also considers all other drug
exposures recorded in the database, significantly expanding the model’s
variables. This approach employs L1-regularization, with
cross-validation used to select the regularization hyperparameter for
all exposures except the one of interest.</p>
<p>An important assumption of the SCCS is that the observation period’s
end is independent of the outcome date. This may not hold true for
outcomes that can be fatal, such as stroke. To address this, extensions
to the SCCS model have been developed that correct for any dependency
between the observation period end and the outcome.</p>

<p>The SCCS method is particularly applicable in several key areas of
epidemiological research and pharmacovigilance:</p>
<p><strong>Drug Safety Surveillance</strong>: The SCCS method is widely
used in drug safety surveillance to identify adverse effects of
medications post-marketing. It is well-suited to detect short-term risks
associated with drug exposures, especially where the onset of the
adverse event is expected to be temporally close to the exposure.</p>
<p><strong>Vaccine Safety Evaluation</strong>: The SCCS design is ideal
for assessing the safety of vaccines, especially in evaluating the risk
of adverse events following immunization. Its self-controlled nature
helps to address concerns about confounding by indication and other
biases that can affect observational studies in vaccine safety.</p>
<p><strong>Comparative Effectiveness Research</strong>: While primarily
designed for evaluating the safety of medical interventions, the SCCS
method can also be adapted to compare the effectiveness of different
treatments or interventions within the same individual over time,
particularly for acute conditions.</p>
<p><strong>Epidemiological Research</strong>: More broadly, the SCCS
method is used in epidemiological research to study the temporal
relationships between exposures and outcomes, offering insights into the
causality and mechanisms underlying health conditions and diseases.</p>

reactions, contributing to safer patient care.</p>
<p><strong>Policy and Clinical Guidelines Development</strong>:
Meta-analytical findings informed by comprehensive, real-world data can
guide policy formulation and the updating of clinical guidelines,
ensuring they are grounded in broad-based evidence.</p>
<p><strong>Addressing Challenges of Small Sample Sizes</strong>: The
EvidenceSynthesis package notably advances the field by tackling the
issue of small sample sizes and zero event counts, which traditional
meta-analytical methods often handle poorly. Its innovative use of
non-normal likelihood approximations enables more precise effect size
estimation under such conditions, ensuring that the insights derived
from meta-analyses are both accurate and meaningful. This attribute is
particularly beneficial in distributed health data networks, where
individual site/database data may be limited but collectively hold
significant informational value.</p>
