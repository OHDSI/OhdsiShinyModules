<p> Below are the descriptions of each tab in the PheValuator Module, which will appear after clicking the "Generate Results" button below: </p>
<ul>
  <li> Phenotypes – phenotypes, with SQL and JSON code, examined using PheValuator. </li>
  <li> Phenotype Performance Characteristics – estimates for sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive value for phenotype algorithms tested by PheValuator. </li>
  <li> Model Covariates – included covariates and beta coefficients of the diagnostic predictive model. </li>
  <li> Model Covariate Summary – for each covariate in the model, provides the count and proportion for the cases and the non-cases used in model development.</li>
    <li> Model Performance – performance characteristics of the diagnostic predictive models used in PheValuator, e.g., area under the receiver operator curve (AUROC). </li>
  <li> Model Input Parameters – R function parameters used in PheValuator to develop the diagnostic predictive models. </li>
  <li> Evaluation Cohort Diagnostics - diagnostics to evaluate the performance of the application of the model to the evaluation cohort. </li>
    <li> Evaluation Cohort Parameters - R function parameters used in PheValuator to develop the evaluation cohort used to determine phenotype algorithm performance. </li>
  <li> Test Subjects – examples of test subjects evaluated to be false positive or negative and true positive or negative. </li>
    <li> Test Subjects Covariates – examples of the associated covariates included in the diagnostic predictive model for test subjects evaluated to be false positive or negative and true positive or negative.</li>
