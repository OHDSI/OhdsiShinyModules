<h3>Self Controlled Case Series</h3>
  <p> SelfControlledCaseSeries is an R package for performing Self-Controlled Case Series (SCCS) analyses in an observational database in the OMOP Common Data Model. This module:</p>

<ul>
<li> Extracts the necessary data from a database in OMOP Common Data Model format. </li> 
<li> Optionally adds seasonality, age, and/or calendar time using spline functions.</li>   
<li> Optionally corrects for event-dependent censoring of the observation period.</li>   
<li> Optionally add many covariates in one analysis (e.g. all drugs). </li> 
<li> Has options for constructing different types of covariates and risk windows, including pre-exposure windows (to capture contra-indications).</li>   
<li> Optionally uses regularization on all covariates except the outcome of interest.</li>   
<li> Provides the self-controlled risk interval design as a special case of the SCCS.</li>   
</ul>
