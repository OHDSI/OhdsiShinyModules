<h3>Description</h3>
  <p> Characterization is an R package for performing characterization of a target and a comparator cohort. This module:</p>
  
  <ul>
<li> Computes full characterization results of target cohorts. </li> 
<li> Computes the binary features for the target and outcome cohorts during the time at risk selected.</li>
<li> Computes incidence rates for the target and outcome cohorts during the time at risk selected.</li>
<li> Computes dechallenge and rechallenge results.</li>   
<li> Computes plot(s) for the databases of the number of events (y axis) during a given time period (1, 30 or 365 days) (x axis) for the target and outcome cohorts selected.</li>
