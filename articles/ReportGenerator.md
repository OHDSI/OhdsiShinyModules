# Report Generator

## Introduction

ReportGenerator is a tool used to create a summary presentation document
using results from a Strategus execution which should be stored in a
results database.

## Description

The Report Generator module allows the user to choose which target (T),
subgroup (indication & extra inclusions), comparator (C), and outcome(s)
(O) they would like a downloaded report on. In the last section of the
module, the user’s selections are reported back to them for review
before downloading. Here, the user can also choose to restrict the study
date and/or the age range of people included in the report.

### Notes

Please note that this package is currently under development, so results
may vary or may not be available at the time of report generation.
